<h1>Jumping Balls Game</h1>

<h3>A game developed and inspirated in <em>T-Rex Game</em> by Google.</h3><br/>

<p align="justify">This game is about a icon that jumps the balls when you click on playing area, objecting not going into the ball, which can make you lose.</p><br/>

<p align="justify">If you make the icon jump the balls correctly, the score in the top of display will show how good you're doing in the game. Have fun!</p><br/>

<p align="justify">When I started developing this game, I had help from Shawn Beaton from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjglHy7pCPF4ES-S7FKxQg" target="_blank">KnifeCircus</a> Youtube channel. 
His tutorial gave me a really nice introduction of how I could develop my own game. So I got insights he threw out in tutorial and then I started developing the project. 
I appreciate his job and I'm so grateful to Shawn for helping me make it possible.</p>
